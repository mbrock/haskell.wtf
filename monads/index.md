WTF are *monads*?
===============

Excellent question!

Unfortunately... this text will probably not help much.

My confession: I love Haskell, I've worked with it professionally, I'm
semi-competent with it, but I can't claim to "understand monads."

Not any more than I'd claim to "understand rings." My other confession
is that I failed the only abstract algebra course I took.

So I don't have much to offer, beyond "you can do it!" That's what the
`do` notation is all about, by the way. Just `do` it.
